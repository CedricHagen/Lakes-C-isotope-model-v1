This code runs a diurnal carbon cycling model, based on code by Dr. Lizzy Trower (https://github.com/lizzytrower/Caicos_d13C/tree/v1.1) but modified to better handle lake geochemistry. 
This version of the model precipitates calcite (rather than aragonite), uses PHREEQC for chemistry calculations rather than CO2SYS (CO2SYS was only designed for marine chemistry), and has
been translated into R from the original MATLAB.
